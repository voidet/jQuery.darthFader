# Darthfader

##An easy to implement jQuery carousel that fades with the force

For an example go [here](http://goplaces.clients.bigfish.tv/)

##Usage
$('#myCarousel').darthFader({"nav": "#optionalNavElement", "delay":2500, "speed":5000});

##Notes
Uses any items for it's next child. DarthFader is like that. So divs, images, spans, UL's, anything. DarthFader uses the force to fade these between each other :)
